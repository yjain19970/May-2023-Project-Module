you have to add more functionalities to ToDo Application. Such as:

1. Create CRUD for ToDos
2. Allowing user to only update the task_status (create a new field Task -> taskStatus in your POJO)
3. Adding validations for required cases and throwing string-error response (as of now)
4. Hot to take RequestParam in SpringBoot and have a variant of Get API using PathParam AND RequestParam


Submission:
* create a new Repo and put the repo link in the google form: https://forms.gle/tp3v4uumg9GcSWPq6
* As of now you can code in the same controller, no need to create serviceClasses
* Can use local memory (DS) and no DB required.


Bonus
* Take Param and filter the data and return according to passed Params. EG:
Sort by (ASC/DESC) : on task_id
