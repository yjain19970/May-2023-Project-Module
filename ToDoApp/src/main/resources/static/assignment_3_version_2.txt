### Assignment

1. you have to complete the remaining methods in controller and service.
2. You also have to handle the validations:
    create / updating / deleting / get
    -> update: if id is not found OR update only allows you to edit the task Status (that's it)
    -> Name: length of name can be 50 ONLY. Similarly, descrip length can be 200char MAX.
    -> return ONLY 1 exception to client at 1 time.

    ## How to Handle validations :(hint)
     -- create a separate validator file. Handle the validations in your service, and throw
     exceptions from there.
3. Implement the buidler as well
4. Create TaskResponseDTO ; as of now we are making use of same DTO, but actually we should have
different DTOs.
